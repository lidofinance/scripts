## How to use long description in vote

In order to get around the limitation on the length of metadata, we added the ability to store a description in IPFS network.

Since the IPFS hash is calculated cryptographically, it is protected from modify data.

We recommend adding a Markdown text description to IPFS. To automatically upload a description to IPFS, you can use a helper `upload_vote_description_to_ipfs` function from `utils.ipfs` and provide the result to `create_vote` and `confirm_vote_script` into description_info argument.

Here are examples of supported syntax:

### Lists


    + Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
    + Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
      - Marker character change forces new list start:
        * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
        + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
        - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
    + Very easy!
